Multiprocessing vs Multithreading in Python

Overview

The difference between multiprocessing and multithreading in Python is shown by this project. When executing a computationally demanding task (testCode()), it calculates and contrasts the execution times of the two methods.

Multiprocessing frequently works better in CPU-bound jobs because Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can prohibit threads from executing in true parallel.

Working

testCode() function This is a user-defined function located in a separate file called Code.py. It represents a workload — either CPU-bound or I/O-bound.

The main script (multithreading_test.py) -This script runs the same task twice: -Using multiprocessing (with 10 processes) -Using multithreading (with 10 threads) -It measures execution time for both and prints a comparison.

How to run: Save both files in the same directory. Run the script: python multithreading_test.py

Observe execution times for both sections.

Observations

The multiprocessing section consistently performed faster than multithreading. Execution time increased as the number of processes/threads increased due to context switching and resource management overhead. Multithreading was slower because Python prevents true parallel execution of threads in CPU-bound tasks. Multiprocessing utilized multiple CPU cores effectively, resulting in faster execution for computational tasks.

Conclusion: Multiprocessing is significantly better for CPU-bound tasks, as each process runs independently on separate CPU cores. .Multithreading is more suitable for I/O-bound tasks (like network requests or file I/O), where threads can work concurrently without heavy CPU competition. .For this experiment, multiprocessing proved nearly 3x faster than multithreading for the same workload.
